# CCTV-Object-detection
The "SBI Hackathon Bank Protection System" uses OpenCV, CNN, YOLO, and SSD to detect harmful objects like fire and knives in real-time from surveillance footage. It alerts security immediately upon detecting threats, enhancing bank safety. This project honed my skills in machine learning for security applications.
